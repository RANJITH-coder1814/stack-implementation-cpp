# stack-implementation-cpp
Basic stack implementation in C++ using arrays with menu-driven operations.

## 📌 Description
This project demonstrates a basic implementation of the **Stack data structure** in C++ using an **array**. The program supports all fundamental stack operations such as **Push, Pop, Peek, and Display** through a **menu-driven interface**. It is designed for beginners learning **Data Structures** and **C++ programming**.

- Peek (view top element)
- Display all stack elements
- Handles Stack Overflow and Underflow
- Simple and beginner-friendly code

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Language: **C++**
- Concept: **Stack (LIFO – Last In First Out)**
